# AlgoWiz

Algorithm Educational App

This project was developed as part of my **Software Practice II** course at the University of Utah.  
It was our team's final project, where we followed Agile development methods to plan, build, and deliver a functional educational tool for visualizing classic algorithms.

## About the Project
**AlgoWiz** is an interactive desktop application that demonstrates key algorithms through real-time animations and user interaction. It is designed to help students understand how algorithms like **Merge Sort**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra's Algorithm**, and various algorithms work under the hood.

The project was built using:
- **Qt** for the GUI
- **C++** for core logic and algorithm implementations
- **Box2D** for physics-based animations

## My Contributions
- Implemented graph traversal visualizations including BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- Helped design and build interactive UI elements using Qt.
- Contributed to team planning and task management using Agile practices (sprints, stand-ups, retrospectives).

The original repository was hosted in a class GitHub organization which will eventually be deleted. This is my personal backup and portfolio copy, preserving the project.

**Note:** Requires Qt and a C++17-compatible compiler.
